| `0x05`     | Motion (PIR)         | 1                  | 0 to 255                                   | Count of motions detected by the PIR sensor since the last transmission.                        |
| `0x07`     | VDD (Battery Voltage)| 2                  | 0 to 65535 mV                              | Battery voltage measured in millivolts (mV).                                                    |
| `0x1C`     | VOC                  | 2                  | 0 to 60000 ppb                             | Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) concentration, measured in parts per billion (ppb).            |
| `0x3D`     | Debug Information    | 4                  | Depends on debug info                      | Information for debugging, which varies based on the data included by the device.               |
| `0x3E`     | Sensor Settings      | n (variable)       | Sent at startup (Port + 1)                 | Device settings sent to the server upon startup. This is sent only once on Port + 1.            |

## Detailed Descriptions

- **Temperature (`0x01`)**: Represented in 2 bytes, with a range of -3276.5 °C to 3276.5 °C. Each value increment of `100` corresponds to an increase of `10.0 °C`.

- **Humidity (`0x02`)**: Represented in 1 byte, with a range of 0 to 100%. This is the relative humidity measured by the device.

- **Light (`0x04`)**: Represented in 2 bytes, with a range of 0 to 65535 Lux. This value indicates the intensity of ambient light.

- **Motion (PIR) (`0x05`)**: Represented in 1 byte, with a range of 0 to 255. This indicates the count of motions detected by the PIR sensor since the last transmission.

- **VOC (`0x1C`)**: Represented in 2 bytes, with a range of 0 to 60000 ppb. This value represents the concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in parts per billion (ppb).

- **Battery Voltage (VDD) (`0x07`)**: Represented in 2 bytes, with a range of 0 to 65535 mV. This value shows the current battery voltage of the device.

- **Debug Information (`0x3D`)**: Represented in 4 bytes. This information depends on the device’s specific debug configuration and is intended for troubleshooting or debugging purposes.

- **Sensor Settings (`0x3E`)**: Variable size, represented by `n` bytes. This data is sent once to the server during device startup (first package) and is sent on Port + 1. It contains the sensor's configuration settings.
